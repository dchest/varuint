Go package varuint implements SQLite4-like variable unsigned integer encoding
as described in http://www.sqlite.org/src4/doc/trunk/www/varint.wiki.

Unlike varint from encoding/binary package, this encoding uses fewer bytes
for smaller values, and the number of encoded bytes can be determined by
looking at the first byte. Varuint also preserves numeric and lexicographical
ordering.

INSTALLATION
	
	$ go get github.com/dchest/varuint 


EXAMPLE

	import "github.com/dchest/varuint"

	...

	buf := make([]byte, varuint.MaxUint64Len)
	n := varuint.PutUint64(buf, 12345)
	buf = buf[:n]
	fmt.Printf("% x\n", buf)
	// Output: f9 27 49

	v, n := varuint.Uint64(buf)
	if n < 1 {
		panic("buffer is too small to contain the expected number")
	}
	fmt.Println(v)
	// Output: 12345
